<h3 id="Introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p> Global CO₂ emissions from aviation have quadrupled since the 1960s (Ritchie, 2024), but is this due to demand or lack in significant advances in efficiency?
  The two are mutually dependent, as the rise of air transit increases - so does the emissions, even with more efficient aircraft. 
  However, with the development of hydrogen fuel it has the potential to significantly reduce harmful by-products. 
  Engineers are working to resolve the design challenges associated with hydrogen propulsion, aiming to achieve comparable performance levels to conventional kerosene fuel. 
  Examining in detail, this article provides an overview of the current state of this technology and examines the engineering innovations necessary to enable its practical implementation </p>

   <h3 id="Analysis and Discussion">Analysis and Discussion</h3>

<p> Hydrogen fuel is a clean energy carrier that, when utilized does not produce carbon dioxide or other pollutants. Once the hydrogen is coupled with oxygen, the reaction generates energy and heat - with water vapour as the only by-product. One property of Hydrogen that makes it attractive as a competitor to kerosene is it's high energy per mass which is approximately three times greater (Adler and Martins, 2023). This comparison is illustrated in Table 1 - the data highlights a clear distinction between kerosene (Jet A) and hydrogen's higher energy density and absence of carbon dioxide emissions.

<p> The two main methods of utilizing hydrogen in aircraft is via combustion in gas turbines and electrochemical conversion in fuel cells. During the combustion method, liquid hydrogen must first be vapourised before it can enter the combustion chamber where it is mixed with oxygen and ignited. The high-temperature gases produced expand rapidly and generate thrust inside the turbine. Although hydrogen is better for the environment than combusting kerosene, it does produce nitrogen oxides (Cranfield Aerospace Solutions, 2024). This is because ideally, the hydrogen would only react with oxygen but the high-temperatures also cause nitrogen in the air to react too. Here is the chemical equation: <p>

<p> Hydrogen-Electric propulsion also involves combining the hydrogen and oxygen but within a fuel cell. However, electrical power is produced and this electricity is supplied to the electric motors connected to the planes propellers or fans. Compared to combustion, this method doesn't produce any nitrogen oxides as it's an electrochemical reaction.<p>

<p> The process of accommodating hydrogen fuel provides many engineering obstacles. It has a low volumetric energy density which means it requires cryogenic (-253°C) or high-pressure storage. <p>
